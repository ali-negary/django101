### Django101
This is going to be my first Django project.

##### Below you can see the steps I took to develop this app.

- models.py configured and database is created.
- Initial steps are taken up until creating admin.
- Admin page created.
- index.html created and improved.
- detail.html created and improved.
- results.html created and improved.
- settings.py was updated with reading from file.
- results, index, and details were implemented with 
- TDD and tests.py
- written some tests more view.py and model.py

*note: if everything works fine, remove the commented line urls.py url patterns.*
